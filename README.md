Conway's Game of Life
=====================

This is my little implementation of the [Conway's Game of Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life), using a very simple algorithm (not Hashlife).

It is written in Lua, using the amazing [Löve2D](https://love2d.org) framework.

Löve and Lua are not required when running on OSX nor Windows,
but if you use a *NIX or the standard `.love` file,
you must get them from your repo's distribution.
